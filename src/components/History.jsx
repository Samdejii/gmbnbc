                        <p className="pb-4 fs-5">Nigerian Baptist was born as a result of Baptist Missions’ 
                        work and the growth gave birth to a lot of developed and highly intellectual
                         foreigners and nationals who helped to sustain the vision and mission of 
                         reaching the unreached with the gospel. <br/><br/>he Global Missions Board therefore
                          is the channel through which the Nigerian Baptist Convention conveys the 
                          message of salvation to the entire world.In 1953, a group of messengers 
                          who were attending the 40th Annual Session of the Nigerian Baptist Convention
                           in Jos, while journeying in a train passionately encountered people who were 
                           half naked physically and presumably spiritually. <br/><br/>Their passionate appeal for
                            the Convention to commence a mission outreach among them was promptly accepted
                             and approved during the 40th annual Convention in Jos. In the same 1953, 
                             the Home and Foreign Mission Department was established and the first Mission
                         Field was opened and commenced immediately among the Unreached People in Shendam 
                         area, near Jos, in present day Plateau State.<br/><br/> The Convention launched forward to
                          open her first Foreign Mission field in Sierra Leone, an English Speaking West
                           African nation in 1961. The Home and Foreign Mission Department was reorganized 
                           in 1999 following the decision of the Convention in session which was held in 
                           the same Jos in 1988, into the Global Missions Board with a further mandate to 
                           reach the entire world with the Gospel of light and love and with a quassi autonomy
                        to take operational decisions on behalf of the Convention. <br/><br/>From 1953, the mission arm 
                        of our Convention has had so great leaders that pioneered and steered the mission 
                        enterprise. <br/><br/>They are: Rev. Dr. John E. Mills, the first secretary to head Home and 
                        Foreign Missions Board (1953); Rev. Paul O. Ebhomielen, the first Nigerian to become 
                        the Secretary of the Board (1964 -1977); Rev. Gorgol Robison (1977 – 1978) followed 
                        by Rev. Reuben E. Oku who served the Board for the period of ten years (1977 to April of 1989);
                         Rev. Etim A. Udoh became the next secretary from May 1st 1989 till 2000; Rev. Dr. 
                         Israel Obieje (2000 – 2011), Rev. Steven Enyi (2011 to 2016), and presently, Rev. Dr Femi 
                         Adewumi (2016 to date).</p>

                             operated this program in partnership with some of our Nigerian Baptist members, Churches 
                             and Theological Institutions in Pobe, Benin Republic (to train indigenous leaders and 
                             Pastors for Benin Republic and Togo) and in Makeni, Sierra Leone (to train indigenous

                    <p className="fs-5">
                    Frontier Mission and Evangelism activities of the Nigerian Baptist Convention will be 70 years 
                    in the year 2023 (from 1953 to 2023). We need your partnership to continue with and to improve 
                    on what our parents, leaders, Churches, Pastors, Deacons, Deaconesses, Laymen and women 
                    (Baptist Professionals) past and present have been used of God to start, nurture and support
                    over the years. <br/><br/>To commemorate this 70th anniversary, we are trusting God to continue 
                    where they stopped by opening 7 new home mission fields in the core north of Nigeria, 
                    particularly in the states where GMB does not have missionaries (Sokoto, Borno, Jigawa, Kano,
                     Zamfara, Bauchi and Katsina) and to extend NBC mission frontiers to at least 3 new International
                      mission fields in Muslim dominated North African Countries (Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt).<br/><br/>
                    We need your partnership to actualize these in the next three to four years. <br/><br/>
