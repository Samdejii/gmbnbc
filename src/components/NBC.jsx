<p>By the close of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, 50 years after Bowen started the work, 42 white and 6 Negro missionaries had served in the Nigerian field. 13 of these died on active service while many suffered ill health. By the turn of the century only 3 families were left in the country, as the Foreign Mission Board never sent new missionaries during the decade 1891 -1901 principally due to shortage of funds and perhaps because of the apparent unimpressive result on ground.</p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF BAPTIST WORK EXPANSION FROM 1914</strong></p>
<p>-From 1914, Baptist work entered a new phase with new initiatives and significant progress in growth, geographical expansion, the founding of new institutions and agencies, increase in the work of missions, and the development of a remarkably successful plan of financial support. Mission work during this period was characterized by the numerical growth of members and baptized converts. As soon s a Baptist community was opened up in an area, it began to spread its tentacles by helping to establish sister churches and preaching stations.</p>
<p>Baptist work also extended to Eastern and Northern Nigeria during the period 1914-1950. Areas touched included Buguma in Niger Delta (though since 1893); Sapele, Calabar or other areas. Between 1915 and 1917, most Delta Baptist Churches were organized by Mojola Agbebi and brought under a common administrative unit called the Niger Delta Baptist Mission, with Buguma as the headquarters.</p>
<p>-Baptist Work expanded to the core Eastern Nigeria in about 1917 with the first location affected being Ihiagwa, not far from Owerri, the capital of the present day Imo State. While the foundation of the work in Ihiagwa is credited to J.T Princewell, a member or Buguma B.C and travelling trader to Ihiagwa, the pioneer missionary to the area was Revd Wariboko Animiyeonu George Amakiri, who succeeded Dr. Mojola Agbebi in his work as the first itinerant Baptist missionary in the Niger Delta.</p>
<p>-It was not until 1943 that an American Baptist Missionary, Rev. W.H. Carson visited Owerri while Rev. Russel L. Locke arrived Owerri in 1957 as the first resident Southern Baptist Missionary in the area.</p>
<p>– The Baptist work was massively expanded to Northern Nigeria by traders and Baptist Missionaries, mostly of Ogbomoso origin who massively moved to such towns as Zungeru, Kaduna, Zaria, Kano, Jos, Minna and environs after the amalgamation of the North and South in Nigeria in 1914. The Southern civil servants who were transferred to the North during the period also aided in the Baptist enterprise expansion.</p>
<p>The expansion and consolidation of Baptist work in Northern Nigeria would not be complete without a mention of the activities of First Baptist Church in Kaduna especially during the years of Revd. I.A Adejumobi and E.O Akingbala.</p>
<p>– The establishment of Baptist work in Benin City and environs is traceable to a disagreement and concomitant schism that erupted in the CMS Anglican Church in the town in 1921 which led to a splinter group organizing an independent fellowship. Thereafter, the group approached the Nigerian Baptist Convention for the establishment of a Baptist Church in Benin in November 1921. To Revd. Obadiah Emokpae goes the credit of consolidating the work in Benin and helping in accelerating Baptist spread in Edo land.</p>
